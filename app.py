    'Sayest thou me so, hag? Out of my ground! ',
    'Dost strike me, slave, curmudgeon! Now, thy bones ache, thy joints cramp, and convulsions stretch and crack thy sinews!',
    'Cursing, thou hag! take that and that.',
    'Ho! have I found thee cursing? now thou art Mine own.',
    'Thine! what art thou?',
    'He thou hast so often Importuned to appear to thee, the devil.',
    'Bless me! the devil?',
    'Come, do not fear; I love thee much too well To hurt or fright thee; if I seem terrible, It is to such as hate me. I have found Thy love unfeigned; have seen and pitied Thy open wrongs; and come, out of my love, To give thee just revenge against thy foes.',
    'May I believe thee?',
    'To confirm it, command me Do any mischief unto man or beast, And I will effect it, on condition That, uncompelled, thou make a deed of gift Of soul and body to me.',
    'Out, alas! My soul and body?',
    'And that instantly, And seal it with thy blood: if thou deniest, I will tear thy body in a thousand pieces.',
    'I know not where to seek relief: but shall I, After such covenants sealed, see full revenge On all that wrong me?',
    'Ha, ha! silly woman! The devil is no liar to such as he loves: Didst ever know or hear the devil a liar To such as he affects?',
    'Then I am thine; at least so much of me As I can call mine own—',
    'Equivocations? Art mine or no? speak, or I will tear—',
    'All thine.',
    'Seal it with thy blood.',
    'Can you perchance get me a love potion that has power over a pious man of the church?',
    'Here, young maiden, take a potion of cat feces and dove hearts, boiled during the full moon. A drop of this in a mans drink will soften his heart at once.',
    'Karna, can i have an even stronger potion?',
    'If the maiden wishes to drive the man out of his wits for love... I have a potion boiled in May from a young and playful male sparrow. Hold your coins, maiden! First smell my ointment! This ointment is good, should you wish to travel to Brocken one night. Secretly smear this ointment on and the pious monk might come directly to your chamber. You will then fly high up in the night air together and he will bestow upon you many hungry kisses.',
    'They say you have had commerce with the devil.',
    'Why do you ask?',
    'For very personal reasons. I, too, want to meet him.',
    'Why?',
    'I must ask him about God. Surely he knows.',
    'You can see him any time.',
    'How?',
    'If you do as I say. Look into my eyes.',
    'Well, do you see him?',
    'I see terror. Nothing else.',
    'Nothing? No one? Nothing?',
    'No.',
    'Is he not behind you?',
    'No. There is no one.',
    'He is with me everywhere. If I stretch out my hand, I feel him. Even now. The fire will not hurt me.',
    'Has he said so?',
    'I know.',
    'Has he said so?!',
    'I know! I know! You must see him, too. The priests could see him, and the soldiers. They dare not touch me.',
    'Why have you broken her hands?',
    'It is not us.',
    'Who?',
    'Ask the monk there.',
    'What have you done to the child?',
    'Will you never stop asking questions?',
    'No. Never.',
    'But you get no answer.',
    'When next we meet, the hour will strike for you and your friends.',
    'And you will reveal your secrets?',
    ' I have no secrets.',
    'So you know nothing?',
    'I am unknowing.',
        'I want to confess as best I can, but my heart is void. The void is a mirror. I see my face and feel loathing and horror. My indifference to men has shut me out. I live now in a world of ghosts, a prisoner in my dreams.',
    'Yet you do not want to die.',
    'Yes, I do.',
    'What are you waiting for?',
    'You want a guarantee.',
    'Call it what you will.',
    'Is it so hard to conceive God with ones senses? Why must He hide in a midst of vague promises and invisible miracles? How are we to believe the believers when we do not believe ourselves? What will become of us who want to believe but cannot? And what of those who neither will nor can believe? Why can I not kill God within me? Why does He go on living in a painful, humiliating way? I want to tear Him out of my heart, but He remains a mocking reality which I cannot get rid of. Do you hear me?',
    'I hear you.',
    'I want knowledge. Not belief. Not surmise. But knowledge. I want God to put out His hand, show His face, speak to me.',
    'But He is silent.',
    'I cry to Him in the dark, but there seems to be no one there.',
    'Perhaps there is no one there.',
    'Then life is a senseless terror. No man can live with Death and know that everything is nothing.',
    'Most people think neither of Death nor nothingness.',
    'Until they stand on the edge of life and see the Darkness.',
    'I see. We must make an idol of our fear, and call it God.',
    'You are uneasy.',
    'Death visited me this morning. We are playing chess. This respite enables me to perform a vital errand.',
    'My whole life has been a meaningless search. I say it without bitterness or self-reproach. I know it is the same for all. But I want to use my respite for one significant action.',
    'So you play chess with Death?',
    'He is a skillful tactician, but I have not yet lost one piece.',
    'How can you outwit Death?',
    'By a combination of bishop and knight. I will break his flank.',
    'I shall remember that.',
    'I will not lie below',
    'Will you let me?',
    'The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.',
    'You will suffer me',
    'The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead, and the dead keep it.',
    'I summon you to fulfill your oath!',
    'The secret is in a kiss. Here are no kisses. Here great Artemis Rules; only in the woodland may a man Hide his eyes from her, pledge himself to Pan. Come! through the tangled arches Of cypresses and larches, Stoop; under Artemis we walked upright; But this is Pans home, and the House of Night.',
    'There is some gloom or doom, A bitter harsh ingredient In these my sorceries Of animal scent.',
    'Yes! there is fear mixed with the fascination. It is the reverence that chastity, be sure! Gains from the impure.',
    'O virtuous nation! It is the fear of the uninitiate Before the throne of Fate The hierophant.',

'Last night, for example.',
'And you want an explanation? I think I should see Sir Malcolm.',
'I can speak for him.',
'Do you believe there is a demimonde, Mr.',
'Chandler? A half world between what we know and what we fear? A place in the shadows, rarely seen, but deeply felt.',
'Do you believe that? Yes.',
"That's where we were last night, where some unfortunate souls are cursed to live always.",
'If you believe in curses, that is.',
'Are you a wise man, Mr.',
'Chandler? Not especially.',
'A wise man would walk away from this house and make a concerted effort to forget everything that occurred last night.',
'He would not look back.',
'That sounds like a warning.',
"It's an invitation.",
'Should you be so unwise as to entertain the idea, we have continued use of a man of your skills.',
'Your kind of man.',
'And what kind is that? One of great violence and hidden depths.',
'You play your role well, Mr.',
'Chandler, but this is not who you are.',
'Tell me what this is all about.',
"Sir Malcolm's daughter was taken by a creature such as the one we killed.",
"We didn't suspect there was another.",
"There's much we don't know and must discover.",
"And what's your part in all this? My part is my own.",
"I've been a hired gun before.",
"Doesn't suit me.",
"There's no exaltation in killing for gold.",
'A wise man after all.',
'Sembene has your money at the door.',
"He'll show you out.",
'I hope you enjoy your life as an actor.',
"It seems to be what you're suited for.",
'But if you find yourself in that demimonde we spoke of, and seek to escape it, you know my address.',
'And what do you seek to escape? Perhaps the same thing you do.',
"We all have our curses, don't we? Good day, Mr.",
'Chandler.',
'Miss Ives.',
"Before you go, one last task, if you'll indulge me: pick a card.",
'No, no, not like that.',
'Not impulsively, not without thought.',
'Let them work on you.',
'Look into my eyes.',
'Believe.',
'__ Was he tempted? Intrigued, I would say.',
"Then he'll be back.",
"- He's intending to leave town.",
"- He won't.",
"We won't let him.",
"I'll require you in an hour.",
'We have an appointment.',
'Where are we going? Amongst dead things.',
'Mother and daughter butchered in east end horror! Westminster Guardian.',
'Only a penny! Undone in Spitalfields.',
'Police fear Ripper is back! Sir Sir Malcolm Murray is outside.',
'The Malcolm Murray? Oh I am extravagantly pleased.',
'Do show him in.',
'And stand up straight, Felix.',
'You look like an orangutan.',
'Mr.',
'Lyle.',
'Sir Malcolm.',
"Oh, it is you! The photograph in your book does you no justice, but do they ever? Say you'll inscribe it for me.",
'Say you will.',
'Your book, I mean.',
'And something deeply personal.',
'It would be a pleasure.',
'This is Miss Vanessa Ives.',
'Could I be more charmed? No, I could not.',
"And what brings you to the humble confines of the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities? Though, really, it's only Egyptian.",
"We don't quite approve the Assyrians, do we? Sit down, do.",
'What are these? Oh, carrion beetles.',
'We employ them when the usual solvents are deemed too abrasive.',
"They eat the flesh, don't you know.",
"Sorry, my dear, it's a bit ghoulish to the lay-person.",
'Very exotic.',
'Where do they come from? Actually, Waveney, in Suffolk.',
'Not exotic at all.',
'Mr.',
'Lyle, I was hoping you could assist me.',
"I've a bit of hieroglyphics in need of translating.",
"These aren't from a scroll.",
"What are they? They're from a tattoo on a corpse.",
"Oh, that's outre.",
'What have you got for me then? Late hieratic script.',
"It's a standard funerary text.",
"Conjoined in this fashion, they translate roughly to an idea meaning 'blood cure' or 'blood transformation.'",
" Although there's a theory it's something more along the lines of a malediction: 'A blood curse.'",
" Trust me, those Egyptians were a bit madcap when it came to specifics.",
"It's all very metaphoric.",
'- Are there more of these? - Yes.',
'I should like to see them, but not here.',
'The British museum is no place for actual scholarship, after all.',
'Perish the thought.',
'And before I engage in professional matters, I feel it is vital to engage in social congress.',
'Get to know the sort of people one is working with, you understand? My wife and I entertain on occasion.',
"Lavishly, you can be sure, as she's absurdly rich.",
"We're having a little fete, Friday next.",
'Perhaps you and Miss Ives could join us? This is a matter of some urgency.',
"Good heavens, Sir Malcolm, there hasn't been anything urgent about the Egyptians for 2000 years.",
"And I'm dreadfully busy now, you understand.",
'Ever so many papyri to translate.',
"Isn't that a delicious word? Papyri.",
"Sounds like something eaten by little Persian boys, doesn't it? So I shall see you Friday next.",
'As you say.',
'Grand.',
"It's resolved.",
"Bring the rest of the photographs with you and we'll take a peek.",
"Entre nous, don't you know? Such an infinite pleasure meeting you both.",
'Our pleasure, Mr.',
'Lyle.',
'Good day, good day.',
'I do assume you know the source of the writing? No.',
"It's from the Egyptian Book of the Dead.",
'Keep clear.',
'Stay there.',
'Look at that blood.',
'Think they suffered much? Bloody right, they did.',
'And that little girl too.',
'She was expecting another, you know.',
"Don't say it.",
'Just starting to show.',
'Picking out names, she was.',
'Is it the Ripper come back? Who else but old Jack? Damn him that did it.',
'Right to hell.',
"I haven't seen him, Maud! A delivery for you.",
'From Sir Malcolm Murray.',
'__ __ Concentrating around the north side, and then moving slowly south, here.',
"That's right.",
'- Sir Malcolm.',
'- Doctor.',
'Hmm.',
"I've spent most of my life in Africa, beholding wonders.",
'I was surprised to get your note.',
'You seem a man who holds his secrets fast.',
"I wasn't going to come.",
"But you couldn't resist.",
'When you see a river, you must follow it to its source, no matter the perils, no matter those comrades that fall along the way.',
'You must know how things work.',
'You must unlock.',
'You are dissatisfied always.',
"Are you dissatisfied? I'm seeking.",
'What? Perhaps the same as you.',
'Mm, I seek the truth.',
"Ah, you're a very young man.",
"I've long since learned that truth is mutable.",
'Perhaps we view science differently.',
'- Do we? - I would never chart a river or scale a peak to take its measure or plant a flag.',
"There's no point.",
"It's solipsistic self-aggrandizement.",
'So too those scientists who study the planets seeking astronomical enlightenment for its own sake.',
'The botanist studying the variegation of an Amazonian fern.',
"The zoologist caught up in the endless fascination of an adder's coils.",
'And for what? Knowledge for itself alone? The elation of discovery? Plant your flag on the truth? There is only one worthy goal for scientific exploration piercing the tissue that separates life from death.',
'Everything else, from the deep bottom of the sea to the top of the highest mountain on the farthest planet, is insignificant.',
'Life and death, Sir Malcolm.',
"The flicker that separates one from the other, fast as a bat's wing, more beautiful than any sonnet.",
'That is my river.',
'That is my mountain.',
'There I will plant my flag.',
'You have the soul of a poet, sir.',
'And the bank account to match.',
'Now why did you want to see me, Sir Malcolm? You tell me.',
'Last night, of course.',
'The body you bought was not, strictly speaking, human.',
'No.',
'- Did you kill him? - Yes.',
'- Are there more? - At least one.',
'And what is your goal? To find a cure for a most rare disease.',
'Hence, Im in a position to offer you employment.',
"You seem to be a freethinker who might imagine a world less constrained by what we think we know of as 'truth.'",
' You mean the supernatural? I mean that place where science and superstition walk hand-in-hand.',
'An anatomist of your skill would be invaluable to my work.',
'You will be well paid.',
'I have no interest in joining an amateur occultist society.',
'Nor I in forming one! It is not a game for me.',
'Then stop playing as if it were.',
'What are you after? Im trying to rescue my daughter.',
'To save her, I would murder the world.',
'Join me, doctor.',
'With me, you will behold terrible wonders.',
'And how much of the world will we have to murder? Do you care? Ive only one other question: why me? Because you were unafraid to pull back the skin and look beneath.',
'Mina? My God Mina.',
'- Youve no doubt? - It was her.',
'Was it an appeal? I dont know.',
'At first there was such a need in her eyes and then something monstrous.',
'My true friend would do you no harm.',
'Our nature doesnt change, only our circumstance.',
'You do not know.',
'Dont I? Was I not responsible? But for my transgression, would any of this have occurred? We cannot unmake the past.',
'We shall live with our guilt, you and I.',
'After all this time, she came to me.',
'I will find her.',
'There was another thought when she was so very close to me, a strange working of memory.',
'I thought of a particular lion hunt many years ago.',
'Youre moving through the tall grass, getting a glimpse of the prey, the shoulders mostly, the mane.',
'You prepare your rifle.',
'Youre very quiet.',
'And then there is a moment.',
'The wind changes, the grass stops swaying.',
'The lion turns, looks at you.',
'The moment you realize you are no longer the hunter, you are the prey.',

"Am I skeptical? About the room.",

"Peter loves you, Father.",
"But Father, if the porters go, how are we to survive? I'm not frightened, I'm not.",
"What an adventure.",
"It's so green, so beautiful.",
"But the porters are dying and I can't go on, I'm sick.",
"Is it the dysentery? I'm bleeding.",
"Oh God, I'm bleeding.",
"I'm shitting blood now.",
"I have no more clean trousers.",

"Can't feel my hands.",
"There's no water.",
"I can't swallow.",
"You knew I was dying didn't you, Father? Did you name a mountain after me? Oh! Amunet, girl? No, much older.",
"Father, Mina's waiting.",
"No! Shhh I wonder I wonder when was the moment you knew you wanted to fuck her? Why were you not more discrete? Vanessa heard you.",
"The two of you.",
"She heard you fucking and she was curious.",
"She walked closer, she rounded the corner and discovered you, the two of you, you know, fucking.",
"Fucking her cunt.",
"Vanessa saw that.",
"Fucking animal.",
"You man.",
"You animal.",
"You man.",
"You animal.",
"Betrayer! Creature! I look into his eyes and they are red with blood like from Peter's ass.",
"His lips are red like blood from her cunt when you fucked her.",
"His teeth are sharp like yours when you bit her cunt and it's so cold and dark and wet like the jungle.",
"Like tears, I am crying.",
"I am so afraid, Father.",
"Find me! Find me! Save me! Save me!",
"Breakfast, Miss Croft? Our usual repast? I won't say 'no.'",
" And call me Bronagh, will ya? The way you say that is ridiculous.",
"Mizz Croft.",
"There's no 'Z' in it.",
"Just being laconic, I suppose.",
"- Oh, like all Americans.",
"- Precisely.",
"So how goes the job hunt? Employment on your feet is hard to come by.",
"I've found a bit of a sideline though.",
"Photographic subject, don't you know.",
"For the calendars and such? If you keep your calendar in a whorehouse.",
"The pictures are a tad risque.",
"What will the bishop think? And what about you? Don't you need to be pursuing work? I have work.",
"I am a maritime supervisor.",
"I sit here and make sure all the boats get past okay.",
"Almost had a collision last night.",
"It was thrilling.",
"- You eaten? - No.",
"Let me buy us some real breakfast.",
"I've got to sleep, but thanks.",
"Well, how about dinner tonight? You're not mistaking me for a sweet little debutante at the summer fair, are you? That kind never did take my interest.",
"Oh, you like things back-alley.",
"I like things to be what they are.",
"Then dinner it is.",
"Anywhere but here.",
"Well, I don't know London much.",
"I do.",
"I'm not asking her back.",
"Although she put Madame Kali to shame, I must say.",
"It was a riveting performance.",
"The dilettantes among the company were outraged, but if one is to engage with the primordial forces of darkness, one must expect a bit of social awkwardness.",
"Although the language tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk! My apologies.",
"My wife mortified, although the gin helped.",
"All right, then, let me see them.",
"Yes, these are the three I've seen.",
"You have had some of this translated, haven't you? - No.",
"- No? This figure, the snake-headed one, that's Amunet, who performed a spectacular star turn last night.",
"Who is she? A goddess: The Hidden One.",
" Why 'The Hidden One'? Because despite her outward divinity, she had a monster within her, not unlike your Miss Ives.",
"This is new.",
"What do you mean? This hasn't been seen before by anyone.",
"- How do you know? - Because it's impossible.",
"Is there more of this? More pictures? - Yes.",
"- I'm going to ask you to do something.",
"Wherever you came across this, whatever your interest, whatever need you think you have, you must forget you ever saw it.",
"First, you tell me why.",
"Amunet was the consort of Amun-Ra, one of the great gods.",
"He was the first 'Hidden One.'",
" The original serpent prince.",
"So named not for any particular reptilian qualities, but for the power of rebirth; like a snake shedding its skin.",
"Everlasting, perpetual life Sustained by feeding on the souls of others.",
"Amunet and Amun-Ra never appear in the same incantation.",
"It is inconceivable in pharaonic religion to conjoin them; their narratives are kept completely separate.",
"- Why? - Because If they ever came together, Amunet would become the mother of evil.",
"All light would end and the world would live in darkness.",
"The hidden ones would emerge and rule.",
"Amunet-Amun-Ra conjoined.",
"This is a spell foretelling the annihilation of man and the coming of the beast.",
"I would not tell Miss Ives this.",
"After all, who wants to know they're hunted by the devil? How long? Victor, how long do we walk? Long walk, yes? Victor, yes? Everything in one day.",
"One night.",
"It's coming to night now, not day.",
"Night.",
"Night.",
"Yes, night.",
"Why are you slow? Now listen, Proteus.",
"This is your very first time outside of this room and it's all going to be very new to you, so try to stay calm, yes? Yes, Victor.",
"Don't be frightened.",

"We met with sir Malcolm and Miss Ives where you work.",
"The American, of course.",
"How do you do? Well, thanks.",
"This is Miss Brona Croft.",
"- Hello.",
"- Miss.",
"Uh this is my friend, Mr.",
"Proteus.",
"Ethan Chandler.",
"How do you do? My name is Mister Proteus.",
"Oh, and this is Miss Croft.",
"How do you do, Miss Croft? My name is Mister Proteus.",

"Yes, very.",
"Enjoy the evening, Mr.",
"Chandler.",
"Miss Croft.",
"Chestnut? Thank you.",
"That's very kind.",
"Enjoy the fairy lights.",
"I always do.",
"What? And what else? Then we saw the frigate and the sloop.",
"Oh, and the barque.",
"Then we met Mr.",
"Ethan Chandler and Miss Brona Croft, our friends on the river Well, perhaps not friends, passing acquaintances, more like.",
"Why? Friends are something different.",
"They're people you've known for a while.",
"You're comfortable with, close to.",
"Like Victor.",
"Yes.",
"Will I have many? If you're lucky.",
"I shall have many.",
"Ten.",
"More than ten if we Your first born has returned Father.",
"Man does not live only in the empirical world.",

"Life and death, the flicker that separates one from the other.",
"Everything else is insignificant.",
"Our young doctor has a secret.",
"- How about dinner tonight? - Anywhere but here.",
"I don't know London much.",
"I do.",
"Mina? She came to me.",
"There was such a need in her eyes, and then something monstrous.",
"Father, Mina's waiting.",
"It's so cold and dark and wet like the jungle.",
"I am crying.",
"I am so afraid, Father.",
"Save me! Save me! This is the spell foretelling the coming of the beast.",
"Amunet, Amun-Ra conjoined.",
"I would not tell Miss Ives this.",
"Who wants to know they're hunted by the devil? Who the fuck are you people? A wise man would walk away from this house and forget everything that occurred.",
"That sounds like a warning.",
"It's an invitation.",
"As you grow up, you'll learn we all do things which cause us shame.",
"Your firstborn has returned Father.",
"There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream The earth, and every common sight To me did seem Apparell'd in celestial light",
" The glory and the freshness of a dream It is not now as it hath been of yore Turn wheresoever I may By night or day The things which I have seen I now can see no more" ,
"Victor, I'm sorry about Bradshaw, he was a good dog.",
"When the poets write of death, it's invariably serene.",
"I wonder if that's what it is really.",
"This death, this ending of things.",
"Is it an ending though, Victor? Or merely a movement? A gesture toward something else.",
"- Toward heaven? - Who can say? There are some things we're not meant to know.",
"Or know too soon, anyway.",
"I shall miss Bradshaw.",
"As will I.",
"'Tis just thee and me now.",
"Ourselves alone.",
"Come away, Victor.",
"Will she die today? No, no, lad.",
"Of course not.",
"Death is not serene.",
"We now commit the body of our sister, Caroline Frankenstein, to the ground.",
"Earth to Earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.",
"Your firstborn has returned Father.",
"Did you think I wouldn't find you? Did you imagine that I was dead? That I could die? You know better, Frankenstein.",
"I would seek you even unto the maelstrom of the blackest tempest of the darkest night.",
"Stand and face me! Look upon this face anew.",
"Is it not well made? Is the language not rich with felicity of expression? Are the eyes not alert? Are these not the eyes that you looked into Once? Hear how I bled.",
"That it was a difficult birth there can be no doubt.",
"I was born in sheer, terrified agony.",
"But surely this was not the Protean man you'd envisioned.",
"This was not a golden triumph over mortality, the lyrical Adonais, of which Shelley wrote.",
"This was abomination.",
"No! And so you fled.",
"The first human action that I experienced was rejection.",
"So do not wonder at my loathing of your species.",
"I waited.",
"But you did not return.",
"Has there ever been a creature so alone? So utterly helpless? Was every new-born creature abandoned the moment they were born? Was this what life was? That upstairs window became my salvation and my tutor.",
"I learned how people were.",
"What the people of the village valued and what despised.",
"How animals were treated.",
"There was no doubt in my mind that I was an animal.",
"How could there be a doubt? Was it not a countenance made for predation? Eventually I learned words.",
"Your beloved volumes of poetry were my primers.",
"From your penciled notations I learned that you favored Wordsworth and the old Romantics.",
"No wonder you fled from me.",
"I am not a creation of the antique pastoral world.",
"I am modernity personified.",
"Did you not know that's what you were creating? The modern age.",
"Did you really imagine that your modern creation would hold to the values of Keats and Wordsworth? We are men of iron and mechanization now.",
"We are steam engines and turbines.",
"Were you really so naive to imagine that we'd see eternity in a daffodil? Who is the child, Frankenstein, thee or me? You ran from me once.",
"Never again.",
"We are the Janus mask.",
"Inseparable.",
"How could you do that? That? That? Aborting your child before it could know pain? It is a mercy.",
"You bore me for nothing but pain! Vanessa Help me.",
"Mina Where are you? They are all about me.",
"The beasts that feed at night.",
"And they are hungry.",
"Please, save me.",
"I need to talk to you.",
"Do you want to hear the rest of our story? Once I resolved to find you, I knew where to look.",
"I knew in which occupation I would find you engaged.",
"The cutting of flesh, the work of the surgeon and the butcher.",
"And so I came to your city.",
"London.",
"Cruel as the Harlot's curse.",
"Watch it! Ahhh! Stay away from her! Get him.",
"- Come here.",
"- No.",
"Ahhh No! - Freak! - Ahh! - That oughta show you! - Ugh! And so it was I learned mankind's capacity for hatred, and mercy, in a single night.",
"What in the name of all the tender mercies happened to you? An accident.",
"Only one thing for it then! Well, yes, not the finest potable in creation, I grant.",
"But we poor theatricals must accept the compromises of our lowered circumstances.",
"That must have been an accident operatic in scope, you poor lamb.",
"Industrial, was it? One of those dreadful clanking machines with gears and cogs and I shall buy you dinner.",
"I know what it is to have no prospects, son.",
"I've suffered the pains of whoremaster fate beyond human endurance.",
"Not an industrial catastrophe to be sure, but something even more insidious.",
"The denigration of one's art.",
"You know Shakespeare, yes? Some.",
"The Immortal.",
"That was my stock in trade, when there was a value placed upon the ineffable and the exalted.",
"When this city aspired to Jerusalem! Do you need work? Yes.",
"Your Visage, creates challenges? It is a horror.",
"Not everywhere.",
"There is a place where the malformed find grace, where the hideous can be beautiful, where strangeness is not shunned but celebrated.",
"This place is the theater.",
"My friend, there was a time this modest hall resounded with Shakespeare, seasons of it, great vomits of it.",
"My last turn was when I gave my Leontes! 'I have drunk and seen the spider!' Ah, but that was many seasons ago.",
"Times have changed.",
"Nowadays, it's all Ibsen.",
"Come! Let us make our entrance.",
"Oh, no.",
"We do not enter here.",
"We use the stage door.",
"Oi, oi, oi! Who's on the blood pump? We are in rehearsals presently for a new offering.",
"The old penny dreadful Sweeney Todd, demonic tonsorial.",
"We present three of the little blood plays at a shot, twice nightly.",
"Our fare is mayhem and malice with all the ingenious gore we can devise.",
"You shall be our new stage rat, responsible for the machinery and rigging.",
"The limelight and gas as well.",
"And if you like, you can live here.",
"- Yes.",
"- Very good.",
"You know, occurs to me, given my total self-absorption, I never asked your name.",
"Fear not.",
"You shall have a nom de theater.",
"Do you know The Tempest? No.",
"You shall be Caliban.",
"Caliban.",
"Who's he? Ah! We'll add it to the bill next week and you'll see.",
"Of course in our version Caliban eats Prospero.",
"Vincent! I'll be back soon.",
"Such a pleasure, my true friend.",
"Welcome to the Grand Guignol.",
"And so I discovered what kindness was.",
"And I found a home.",
"That's wonderful.",
"Thank you.",
"Yes.",
"Could there have been a more appropriate place for me? Night after night, the players died gruesomely and then came back to life again for the next show.",
"They were undying, like me, creatures of perpetual resurrection.",
"I was not welcomed by all.",
"How could this face, this form, fit with ease amongst the mortal and the beautiful? I learned to stay in the shadows to protect such a heart as this you gave me.",
"But still, I was a member of the company in my way and I proved an able and agile worker.",
"You made me strong and tireless.",
"If only you had made me handsome.",
"Once I found my occupation at the theater it was a simple thing to slip out at night and hunt for you.",
"And then I followed you and I waited.",
"I saw your progress with my lamented younger brother.",
"Did you not feel me near, I wonder? Did you not feel my gravitational pull? My inexorableness? What do you want of me? To suffer? You've done that.",
"I'm sorry I left you.",
"I'm sorry for the cruelty you've endured, that I inflicted upon you, but I cannot unmake the past! I'm not concerned with the past, only the future.",
"Rise and walk with me, creator.",
"I'll show you what I want.",
"Hmm.",
"Do you have medicine? For the lungs you mean? No, who has money for that? Not when there's eating to be done, my lad.",
"No, no, no.",
"I'd say we'd do better to come in off the boardwalk, up by the Chester Road.",
"Somewhere about there.",
"Sir, Mr.",
"Chandler is here.",
"Send him in.",
"Sir.",
"Miss Ives.",
"Mr.",
"Chandler.",
"I'll not waste your time.",
"I'm looking for money.",
"I'll work for it.",
"Well, I must say your timing couldn't be more fortuitous.",
"We are intending to undertake another expedition.",
"Whatever it is, yes.",
"Miss Ives will explain the details as far as she sees fit.",
"Excuse me.",
"Are you seeking passage back to America then? Not much for me there, except my father.",
"There's no love lost between us.",
"You don't miss your home? Landscape's nice.",
"Legal system less so.",
"Sir Malcolm hasn't found her? No.",
"But she came to me.",
"I take it you don't mean knocked on the door and said hello.",
"I I see things sometimes.",
"I am affected by forces beyond our world.",
"You don't question that? There's a lot I question about all this, but not that.",
"Will you sit down? So, what we're planning is What happened to Mina? She was working as a governess and became engaged to a Mr.",
"Jonathan Harker.",
"But then, she became embroiled with another man.",
"But not entirely a man, something else altogether, perhaps one of many like him, we don't know.",
"This creature influenced her behavior and now she has become his slave, hovering between our world and his.",
"Who's the man? If man he be.",
"We don't know.",
"But you think you know where she is? We might.",
"Have you ever been to London Zoo? You've learned much since you created me.",
"Your new child was elegant, both of form and limb.",
"Sweet-tempered, too, from what I gathered.",
"And he learned more quickly than did I.",
"Of course he had a teacher.",
"He had a name.",
"You gave him a name? He picked it himself.",
"He was called Proteus.",
"What do you want from me, demon? So now I have a name, and yet you will not look at me.",
"What do you want from me? You know what I want.",
"Don't torment me.",
"You say this to me? Tell me.",
"In this life, there are hungers that compel us.",
"Food, shelter, warmth, even poetry.",
"But one thing stands titanic.",
"Name it.",
"Love.",
"Top marks.",
"I can never love you.",
"I do not seek your love, demon! I do not seek what is not there.",
"I would weep for you if ever I'd learned how.",
"No.",
"I seek a companion.",
"Look around.",
"Take your pick.",
"You will make me an immortal mate.",
"A woman.",
"Like myself, everlasting.",
"This you shall do.",
"Or I will strike down all those you love and render your brightest day your darkest night.",
"You seek to threaten me with death? If you seek to threaten me, threaten me with life.",
"Do not test me, Frankenstein.",
"You have not known horror until I have shown it to you.",
"You had a vision then, of Mina here? That's it? Mina wouldn't have appeared to me but for her great need.",
"I interpret these signs as best I can.",
"Whatever happens tonight with Miss Ives, let it unfold.",
"Meaning what? Her gifts make her vulnerable.",
"They also make her desirable.",
"To whom? Let's carry on then.",
"Is she here? There's something wrong here.",
"What haven't you told me? Don't fire.",
"Don't move.",
"Miss Ives, do not turn your head.",
"Let's go.",
"No, no, Mr.",
"Chandler.",
"Forebear.",
"We shall need some sturdy chains, I think.",
"Sir Malcolm requires you.",
"What's your name? My name is Fenton.",
"Her name is Vanessa.",
"How do you know about that, Mr.",
"Fenton? Fear already? You will not survive long in this cruel old world.",
"Tell me of your master.",
"Where is your master? Right behind you.",
"Don't you feel him in the dark? On the back of your neck, his breath.",
"Now one finger reaching out.",
"Do you not feel it? Well, you soon will.",
"And then And then All light will end and the world will live in darkness.",
"The Hidden Ones will emerge and rule Amunet.",
"Amun-Ra.",
"Do you know the name Mina? I know the name Vanessa.",
"Naughty girl.",
"Mother will punish you, you cock-sucking whore.",
"- Where is your master? - Hold on.",
"Will you beat me, Mother? Have I been naughty? I only wanna eat, like all poor creatures.",
"I am so hungry! Ahh! Where is your master? Everywhere.",
"Where is your master? I'm so hungry.",
"Where is your master? Oh.",
"I'm late to the party.",
"He's the first real connection we have to Mina.",
"It is an invaluable opportunity we cannot afford to waste.",
"Even if it means beating him to death? Suddenly sentimental about bloodletting, Mr.",
"Chandler? Maybe I don't take to torturing children.",
"Killing redskins more your line? You know nothing about it.",
"Whole Indian nations pacified into nonexistence, what don't I know? How do you know I was in the Indian wars? I didn't.",
"Gentlemen, the matter at hand Doctor? As a subject, he's promising.",
"If you seek a cure, you'll need a subject for experimentation.",
"A cure for what? I'll have to make a proper examination, but I would think the disorder is not mental, the physiological symptoms are too marked.",
"I would begin treatment as if it were, say, Dengue fever or one of the other rare blood disorders.",
"Perhaps transfusion.",
"To what end? Removing the toxins from his system and seeing if there are any improvements.",
"It may be a way to treat your daughter if she is similarly afflicted.",
"The whole thing's steeped in blood, so why not start there? Why not? You've got a kid chained up in your basement and you're talking about experimenting on him like he's some kind of rat, when you're not talking about torturing him.",
"Then leave this house.",
"We here have been brutalized with loss.",
"It has made us brutal in return.",
"There is no going back from this moment.",
"If we are to proceed, we proceed as one.",
"Without hesitation and with fealty to each other alone.",
"This, we seek, demands nothing less.",
"It is not for the weak or the kind.",
"No one in this room is kind.",
"That's why you're here.",
"Now look into each other's eyes.",
"And pledge to go as far as your soul will allow.",
"Swear it now.",
"Give your assent, Mr.",
"Chandler, or leave this company and its mysteries behind.",
"I'm with you.",
"And I with you, Ethan.",
"And since we're compacted, I have a question.",
"Tonight, in the zoo, Mina was not there.",
"- Did you know? - I feared.",
"Why? Why? I think it's possible the creature we seek doesn't want her.",
"He wants you.",
"- For what purpose? - I don't know.",
"Tell me.",
"- Tell me.",
"- I don't know.",
"So I was bait? Yes.",
"I took a room at the Mariner's Inn on the other side of the river.",
"Why there of all places? Mmm.",
"What's her name? Bronagh.",
"It means 'sadness' in Gaelic.",
"Does she live up to the name? I can't tell.",
"She has consumption.",
"Then she will.",
"Who doesn't love a lost cause? I've spoken to the hematologist I mentioned before.",
"He's short of funds so he'll consult with us.",
"Pretty sort of doctors we are, bartering our services like this.",
"- So you'll come tomorrow? - Yes.",
"And I'll bring supplies for the transfusion.",
"- You will have money for me? - Yes.",
"There is one thing you need to consider.",
"When you transform a life, you're making it anew.",
"Whatever happens to that creature downstairs, we are responsible for it.",
"It is our burden now.",
"Every action builds another link that binds us to it.",
"That chain is everlasting.",
"Work tomorrow, Doctor.",
"Get some sleep.",
"Who can survive the dreams? Master? Master? I am here.",
"Her gifts make her vulnerable.",
"They also make her desirable.",
"Vanessa Help me.",
"What happened to Mina? She became embroiled with a creature.",
"Now she has become his slave, hovering between our world and his.",
"They are all about me.",
"And what's your part in all this? My part is my own.",
"I lost a son in Africa.",
"Father mine, let me come with you.",
"I'll prove myself a proper explorer.",
"Peter loves you, Father.",
"Amunet, girl? No, much older.",
"Amunet was the consort of Amun-Ra, the original serpent prince.",
"He was sustained by feeding on the souls of others.",
"I would not tell Miss Ives this.",
"Who wants to know they're hunted by the devil? What's happened? It came after you.",
"I think it was all a ploy.",
"But it was Mina who led me to him.",
"That she may be your enemy.",
"Can you blame her? Where's Vanessa? I want Mother.",
"Why do you want her? Why does everyone want her? But for my transgression, would any of this have occurred? We cannot unmake the past.",
"We shall live with our guilt, you and I.",
"My dearest Mina, my darling friend.",
"I began these letters when I recovered from my illness.",
"At first, I composed them perhaps every month.",
"Then weekly and now daily.",
"Soon I will, no doubt, give up all other occupation and simply write.",
"The ending of one letter becoming the beginning of the next, an endless ribbon of words.",
"I write in hope that one day you will answer me and that everything can again be like it was Though I know that can never be.",
"I don't remember clouds when we were young.",
"Were there any, my dearest Mina? Just beyond the horizon, perhaps? Or was it all seashore and sandcastles? Such a thought is naive, I know.",
"But aren't memories always that? Let's go in and go terribly far out.",
"We mustn't.",
"We'll get in trouble.",
"You're afraid.",
"No, I'm not.",
"Then come in with me.",
"How far do you think we could swim? Far as we want.",
"Everywhere.",
"And what would we do when we got there? Everything.",
"I think we should go in and go as far out as we can see.",
"No, we shouldn't.",
"Will you always be afraid, Mina mine? Were ever two families closer than ours? I don't remember a day that gate between our homes was closed.",
"Until the day it closed forever.",
"Hello, Mrs.",
"Murray.",
"Gorgeous day for the homecoming.",
"We're all at sixes and sevens.",
"Children are in the solarium.",
"Good morning, Mr.",
"Andrews.",
"Good morning.",
"Good morning.",
"Good morning, Peter.",
"God, still at that monkey? As much as I try, it just looks - Dead.",
"- He's not an 'it,' he's a 'he.'",
" Give him a name.",
"Van, he's a stupid dead monkey.",
"You have to give them names or they'll never come to life.",
"It's like a witch's spell.",
"This is Ariel from the Shakespeare.",
"You're forever working on things that eat other things.",
"I think you're bloodthirsty.",
"I'm bloodthirsty.",
"She's just ghoulish.",
"I think Mr.",
"Andrews has the most luxurious mustaches.",
"- I know, he's gorgeous.",
"- And so tall.",
"I'm sure I'll marry a tall man.",
"I couldn't love someone stunted, it'd be too embarrassing at balls.",
"- What sort of man will he be? - Hmm Over 6 feet at least.",
"With mustaches he waxes daily and tiny feet for dancing.",
"What about you? Anything but one of father's dreadful solicitors.",
"Then, of course, you're going to marry Peter.",
"Everyone says so.",
"I shan't be here to marry you, Van.",
"Where will you be? In Africa with father.",
"Are you sure you want to be an explorer? Well, I can't be making stuffed monkeys my whole life.",
"Be careful with those bags.",
"- Father! - Hello, Peter.",
"Father! And there's my girl.",
"Hello! You're so thin.",
"I can feel your ribs this time.",
"And you haven't worn your hat.",
"Oh, you've caught me out.",
"That was the first thing I lost.",
"- What was the second? - My way.",
"Hello, Gladys.",
"None of that, dear.",
"What did you bring me? Well, let's see What have we got here? Now Ugh.",
"- What is it? - It's a serval.",
"Genus Leptailurus from the shores of Lake Tanganyika.",
"- How gorgeous.",
"- Thank you, Father.",
"Now, I'm as hungry as a crocodile.",
"Have you put on a proper feast? Excuse me? Those festive homecomings I remember most.",
"They were our true holidays.",
"My mother and father were always welcome company at your table.",
"Your father would return to us with rare gifts and a sunburn.",
"Now, would anyone like to hear about my encounter with the cannibals? Yes? Good.",
"But rarest of all were his tales of adventure, I'm sure much edited for our ears.",
"when we suddenly heard a cry Nyame.",
"Peter's eyes would light up.",
"Such a marvelous future he imagined alongside his father.",
"Food.",
"Us.",
"That's just awful.",
"Shall we begin? But for all our kinship, my Mina, we were not completely alike.",
"The mysteries of my Catholic church were alien to you and your family.",
"Had I been older, I would have seen more.",
"Beneath the laughter, beneath that great, easy outpouring of conversation, it wasn't tension exactly, was it? Not amongst two such congenial families.",
"No.",
"It was more a tremor of something.",
"Like words hollered down a bottomless pit that come back occluded and more complex.",
"Adulthood, maybe.",
"And on that terrible night, that night it happened, did anything particularly important happen at the dinner? No, not that I recall.",
"Honestly, I thought I was going to find you and Peter around the next corner, playing some trick on me.",
"My mother.",
"Your father.",
"More than the shock, the sinfulness, the forbidden act, there was this.",
"I enjoyed it.",
"Something whispered.",
"I listened.",
"Perhaps it has always been there, this thing, this demon inside me.",
"Or behind my back, waiting for me to turn around.",
"I didn't tell you what I saw.",
"How could I? There was no need for you to grow up so fast.",
"- Tomorrow, we should go into town.",
"- Yes.",
"You could not have endured it.",
"Or so I told myself.",
"Perhaps I was just cherishing the secrecy of it as a hidden sin.",
"But in me, there was a change.",
"I marked it from that night in the hedge maze.",
"Perhaps it was always there.",
"Little acts of wickedness.",
"Harmless, of course.",
"Something any girl would do.",
"I told myself it was no more than mischief.",
"But I knew it was more.",
"Of course I did.",
"Cold blows the wind To my true love And gently drops the rain I have never had but one true love And in Greenwood he lies slain And as we grew up, and you grew lovelier, it was no wonder to me that you met your gentleman first.",
"Or that he had luxurious mustaches.",
"Such a gallant young officer.",
"What a handsome couple you were.",
"Found you.",
"Thank you.",
"It was the season of Peter's inadequate beard, I watched your courtship with Captain Branson flourish.",
"All the stratagems of advance and retreat.",
"I always thought of myself as the stronger one.",
"But here, you were so valiant.",
"How could he not be conquered? I think you set your future at that table.",
"He spoke of India and suddenly I saw you going.",
"When would I see you again? Isn't India so terribly far away? What would I do? Marry Peter? God, how I envied you.",
"Perhaps I even hated you.",
"How was it possible that you, always so meek and obliging, were to have this greatest of adventures before me? You would know love, you would know a man's touch, while I, the courageous one, knew nothing of life.",
"Mina, my dear.",
"Of course, he's a fine man.",
"I've no doubt of that.",
"He'll make a proper husband.",
"But I hate to think of her out in India with all that heat and those filthy wogs.",
"What do you think Africa will be like? Oh, God, Van.",
"Don't mention that.",
"Every time I try and talk with father about it, he shies away.",
"Maybe you shouldn't ask anymore.",
"It's all I've ever dreamed about.",
"You know that.",
"My father and I off on an adventure, blazing some daring new trail.",
"Perhaps What? Perhaps then, I wouldn't be such a disappointment to him.",
"I was never the son he wanted.",
"Always ill, never good at games.",
"A disappointment.",
"He needed someone more like Me? You'll be all alone when I go.",
"Mina in India, me with Father.",
"That'll be sad for you.",
"But I suppose The minister's coming at seven and mother wants us there.",
"You know how she is about time.",
"If I could only go back now, I would run after him and say, 'Don't go.'",
"Don't go to Africa.",
"You'll never survive, you're too weak.",
"You're beautifully weak, Peter.",
"I love you for your weakness.",
" For at that moment, Mina, I saw the future crystal clear.",
"I tried to pray that night.",
"God didn't answer me.",
"But another did.",
"Soon, child.",
"What games we will have.",
"You were never happier than that weekend.",
"On the following morning you would be married.",
"One more night as Miss Mina Murray before you became Mrs.",
"Charles Branson.",
"All right.",
"Bye-bye.",
"You didn't seem to mind this loss of self.",
"Perhaps I minded it for you.",
"You've found me out.",
"Last night of freedom, eh? Would you like to see something interesting? No.",
"My Mina? Your Mina.",
"Although you'll be relieved to know she only worked with the most pacific of animals.",
"This is her squirrel.",
"Which are yours? Not the docile ones.",
"That doesn't surprise me.",

"At the end of the day, the only thing we have is the people we trust.",
"And you trust her? You better start doing the same, or get ready to lose a lot of battles.",
"Vanessa, I have a lot to tell you.",
"I haven't been honest with you about To be beautiful is to be almost dead, isn't it? Mmm The lassitude of the perfect woman, the languid ease, the obeisance, spirit-drained, anemic, pale as ivory and weak as a kitten.",
"There's a brisk trade for photographs of dead women, did you know that? In certain quarters.",
"The corpses are improved with cosmetics, then posed in postures of abject surrender and photographed.",
"The men circulate the pictures and pleasure themselves.",
"Mmm, such exquisiteness.",
"Vanessa? Do you hear me? Of course.",
"Last evening, you went into a a spell, or a fit of a kind, unlike previously.",
"Did I? How arresting.",
"It was unnatural.",
"Do you not remember? You've been asleep since.",
"Who dressed me? Oh.",
"Sembene and myself.",
"Did you make the tea then? What? No.",
"Sembene did.",
"And you dressed me? Yes.",
"Like when I was a girl? Oh, no.",
"You didn't dress me as a girl.",
"How silly of me.",
"You weren't there to dress me, were you? You were away on some trek or other.",
"Who could keep them straight? We tried to follow your progress on that map in the solarium with little red pins but you were in terra incognita.",
"That's where you said you were going.",
"What adventure in those words.",
"Do you feel you are there again Father? Mina? Somewhat.",
"Fat Mother wept, of course.",
"Is there anything more comical than a fat woman weeping? It never quite comes off.",
"You loathed her fatness.",
"Unlike those other women.",
"But fat Mother wept because she missed you, and feared for you.",
"Wept and wept and then she bit into her pillow so we wouldn't hear her, and then she turned to laudanum to sleep at all.",
"Poor fat thing.",
"Tell me about the other women.",
"Not Mrs.",
"Ives, I know all about her.",
"You might have attended the funeral at least.",
"For decency's sake! You stop this right now.",
"Ooh, it's that face, is it? The hard face for the niggers.",
"Scare them into obeying.",
"The porters and slaves.",
"But we were speaking of the women.",
"They were as follows The whores in Zanzibar when you landed, mostly North-African so almost white.",
"Then the native women along the way.",
"They enjoyed you pawing at them.",
"Or you convinced yourself they did.",
"You made Peter fuck them to prove he was a man.",
"He didn't enjoy it, but he would do anything for you.",
"Except make a proper off spin bowler like you wanted.",
"So on you went, tribe to tribe, father and son, fucking the Maasai, the Mamohela, the Bangweulu the Bantu, the Burundi! Honestly, I'm sorry they've troubled you.",
"I'm quite well again.",
"And where did you receive your medical degree, Dr.",
"Ives? Would you excuse us? Go on, Sir Malcolm.",
"He fears for my modesty I think.",
"May I make a discreet examination? Ah, discretion always.",
"What happened to your lip? Sembene thought it necessary to 'sedate' me.",
"You've a steady pulse.",
"Yes, I believe I am still alive.",
"Would you come into the light for me? And look up to the left, to the right.",
"I fear I'm not looking my best.",
"Nonsense.",
"Your visual responses are perfectly adequate.",
"High praise.",
"No wonder you're not married.",
"May I listen to your heart? Such as it is.",
"- It's cold.",
"- I'm sorry.",
"I always forget that with the living.",
"Deep breaths.",
"What happened downstairs? I couldn't rightly say.",
"Then wrongly say.",
"I don't remember.",
"It's a shambles.",
"Is it? There was violence.",
"There usually is.",
"When's that? When I go away.",
"Where do you go? I don't know! Meaning you will soon bring in an alienist.",
"No.",
"I don't favor that.",
"Nor I.",
"You must eat something.",
"I'm not hungry for soup.",
"Well, I'm sure they will give you anything you like.",
"Cornish game hen, expertly carved by a beautiful boy in a restaurant.",
"You have very clean hands.",
"Yes, I suppose so.",
"Do you value cleanliness? I suppose I do.",
"That's why you're a virgin.",
"Or maybe not.",
"Who can tell about such things? Such hidden things.",
"Such secrets we all have, don't we, Doctor? There's a line from Shelley that haunts me.",
"A single line, from Adonais.",
"I can't seem to get it out of my head.",
"No more let Life divide what Death can join together.",
" Your clean hands are trembling.",
"Are you afraid? Not of you.",
"You think you know a greater demon? Tell me of him, or shall I tell you? Is the examination over? It has not yet begun.",
"I've called Mr.",
"Chandler to assist us.",
"It has happened before, but never to this extent.",
"She fights it as best she can.",
"What brings on the fits? I don't know.",
"Emotion of some kind.",
"What brought on this one? I don't know.",
"I must ask you a difficult question.",
"Has she experienced sexual trauma in her life? I've no idea.",
"Is she intact? I wouldn't have thought so.",
"I place no judgment on that.",
"I have no interest in your judgment.",
"Miss Ives is manifesting a deep psychosexual responsiveness.",
"I would say the root of her condition lies there.",
"In guilt.",
"Something or someone has triggered it.",
"Well, last night she went out with a young man.",
"All right.",
"Let's imagine this.",
"She has an erotic encounter with this man.",
"Perhaps her first, we don't know.",
"And it evolves into some sort of sexual extremity or perversity that produces feelings of guilt or shame.",
"That might stimulate a psychological break or dissociation which Did you bring your weapons? - Yes.",
"- Come.",
"My God.",
"Mr.",
"Chandler.",
"Forgive me.",
"I am not myself.",
"My dear Miss Ives.",
"Can I help you in any way? You have no idea how I fight this thing, but it is adamantine.",
"What thing? This thing inside me.",
"No one has taken my hand so sweetly for many years.",
"May I ask you a question, Mr.",
"Chandler? Of course.",
"Did you fuck him or did he fuck you? The beautiful boy of our dreams.",
"The irresistible one.",
"You know who I mean.",
"He fucked you, didn't he? Goddamn, did you enjoy it? I think we'll tell Brona.",
"Yeah.",
"We'll tell Brona.",
"Of course, she already knows the boy.",
"Didn't she tell ya? Oh, I'm so sorry.",
"He fucked her while she bled.",
"I don't need to tell you how much she enjoyed it.",
"Ask her to show you the pictures.",
"The sedative, Doctor.",
"Ah.",
"Is the child killer back for more? No sons for you to kill here, Malcolm! Help me! Help me.",
"Keep your hands off me, virgin doctor! Restrain her! Leave her! You imbeciles! Leave her to me! You men, you men, you men! What's wrong with her? She's been possessed by the Devil.",
"Oh, fuck me.",
"Or a devil.",
"Who can say? There is a pantheon I believe.",
"Well, you're a doctor.",
"Do something! This is a bit beyond my usual practice.",
"There is, I believe, a larger plan at work here.",
"Something beyond even the monstrousness we have witnessed.",
"I spoke to an Egyptologist who suggested the creature we seek might believe Miss Ives to be an incarnation of the goddess Amunet.",
"Should that creature take hold of her it would unleash untold horrors.",
"For Christ's sake, we gotta get her a priest.",
"Don't be insulting.",
"Might as well call a witch doctor or an old gypsy woman.",
"Shut the fuck up.",
"No priest.",
"We cannot bring anyone else into this.",
"So what's the plan? We keep her alive while she fights this thing.",
"We show her she is not alone.",
"Remember what you said to me? 'At the end of the day, the only thing we really have is the people we trust.'",
" She trusts us.",
"Will you stay and help us? You know I will.",
"Did you understand the words she said to me? It was Arabic.",
"She said, 'Let me die.'",
"Mr.",
"Chandler.",
"Miss Ives.",
"You're awake.",
"So it would seem.",
"How long have I been asleep? A week more or less.",
"Though you do wake up and get feisty every now and then.",
"I can only imagine.",
"Is there water? I'm not going to hurt you.",
"It gets pretty rough sometimes.",
"Our friend, the doctor, thinks we might have to restrain you to keep you from hurting yourself.",
"He would, wouldn't he? You don't know what it's like having this thing inside me.",
"Always scratching.",
"That's an awful word, but that's what it feels like.",
"An animal scratching to get out.",
"Should we get you a priest? Someone to talk to? Would that help? I don't know, I've fallen from the faith.",
"But, yes.",
"Yes.",
"Then we will.",
"I don't remember what happens really, but some things I do.",
"You've been kind.",
"Everybody.",
"Not like you.",
"I might have fallen in love with you.",
"You don't mind me saying that? You still might.",
"Don't let me hurt anyone.",
"I won't.",
"They won't stop me.",
"They haven't the heart for it.",
"But you do.",
"When the moment comes, look into my eyes, and pull the trigger.",
"And send you to heaven? If you believe in that.",
"Oh, I do.",
"But I believe in the other place more.",
"'Course, I know that place pretty well.",
"You might say it's where I was flung when your fucking cunt of a God cast me out.",
"You don't recognize your old friend, Vanessa? So it's this game again? I thought you liked games.",
"You certainly did with Mr.",
"Gray.",
"Am I meant to give you a name again? Is it Satan now? Or do you fashion yourself Lucifer, the Fallen Angel? That's how you fashion me.",
"How pitiable you are! Forever hiding your face in the guise of others.",
"Are you afraid? Always.",
"But do you know what I fear most of all? A life thwarted.",
"Greatness promised, but never achieved.",
"If your goal is to have me surrender to you, that day will never come.",
"I could kill you.",
"Choke out your life.",
"Seize up the heart.",
"Then do it! You can't resist me forever, darlin'.",
"But I can now.",
"Say I kill them downstairs.",
"Do it! My soul remains my own.",
"Tell me what you want of me right now.",
"No more evasions.",
"I want you to be the mother of evil.",
"I want you to rule the darkness with me.",
"At my side.",
"Looking over a black, scorched, dead world.",
"Where there is no more pain, because there are no more hearts to feel.",
"We have eaten them all, thee and me.",
"And together we will conquer God.",
"Topple him from his bloody throne, and rule in his stead.",
"Everlasting.",
"Darkling, listen.",
"Have you thought about my offer? Coming to Africa? Don't need the glory.",
"Don't underestimate the value of prestige.",
"For Christ's sake! What are you trying to prove? That you're still young? That you're still relevant? Or are you just running away again? Something you know intimately.",
"- Don't.",
"- Getting angry? Fuck you! That mysterious past of yours.",
"How far can you run? You know what, I have a father! I don't need another one! And you had a son and you killed him.",
"Am I missing anything? Lord, are we ever getting out of this house? Do you know why I must go to Africa? I don't care.",
"Yes, you do.",
"I buried my son Peter on the shores of Lake Tanganyika.",
"He was like a skeleton.",
"The insects had gotten to him.",
"I carried him to the grave and put him in.",
"He weighed practically nothing.",
"And then I left, because I still had to survey the northern end of the lake to ascertain if any of the outlets might be the source of the Nile.",
"It's a fever, this Nile quest, as I told you.",
"I am returning to bring my son's body home.",
"At least that's what you tell yourself.",
"Yes, that's what I tell myself.",
"You're not that good.",
"I know.",
"We must restrain her or she'll kill herself.",
"Don't let me hurt you! Please! Quickly! Morphine? Yep.",
"Is it an addiction? Yes.",
"Caused by what? Pain.",
"My turn upstairs.",
"How is she? Sleeping, I think.",
"Good.",
"The best thing.",
"And for you, too.",
"So what the hell do we do now? I'm going to try a transfusion in the morning, some vitamins, essential proteins.",
"That'll keep her alive to fight on anyway.",
"Fight on.",
"But for all our efforts, we may have to let her go.",
"Go where? Do you believe in God? No.",
"I wish I did.",
"I believe in everything but God.",
"I have to tell you something, I'm not sure Sir Malcolm is being honest with us.",
"- About what? - Miss Ives.",
"I know he doesn't want her to die, but I'm not quite sure why he wants her to live.",
"He cares for her.",
"She's like a daughter.",
"No.",
"She's not.",
"That's the problem.",
"You know the saddest thing I ever saw? When the army pacifies a native tribe, they take the children away.",
"They cut off their hair, which is a source of spiritual strength to them, you see.",
"They take away their medicine bags, they give them new names.",
"John Smith.",
"William Sherman.",
"Then they ship them East to boarding school.",
"Awful.",
"That's not the worst.",
"Sometimes a John Smith or William Sherman would escape and make it back to their home tribe.",
"Well, they've forgotten their language, their stories.",
"They are unwelcome.",
"So what do they do? They don't fit in either world.",
"Like Miss Ives? Like Miss Ives.",
"So what do they do? They roam and they die.",
"Oh, it's snowing.",
"Can I ask you a favor? It's heavier than you thought.",
"You'll get used to that.",
"The trick is not pulling the barrel up when you're aiming because of the weight.",
"Point the gun down, and carefully pull back the hammer with your other hand.",
"So lethal.",
"You'll get used to that too.",
"Now raise the gun and point it down there.",
"Now put your finger on the trigger very gently, like you're touching a lady's neck.",
"Well, like surgery, then.",
"Now this is going to be very loud.",
"When I tell you, I want you to take an easy breath out and then an inhale.",
"At the top of the inhale, I want you to gently squeeze the trigger.",
"Don't jerk it, just gently squeeze.",
"Easy exhale and inhale.",
"Fire.",
"All right! Again? Go crazy, Dr.",
"F.",
"Take it easy, Annie Oakley.",
"You do it.",
"- No, no, no, no, no, no.",
"- Go on.",
"Look, I was a professional sharpshooter.",
"You know you want to.",
"Whoo! What about a rifle? Do you have a rifle? Sir Malcolm is inquiring about the noise.",
"Uh-oh.",
"We're in trouble with Dad.",
"This is good.",
"I picked up the rudiments of cooking on the trail back home.",
"Always thought myself a dab hand at the spices.",
"In America, yes? New Mexico Territory mostly.",
"But all over really.",
"California, all the way to the Pacific.",
"When I first saw the ocean, I thought it must be a lake.",
"Nothing could be so large.",
"Not even the Mountains of the Moon.",
"So, what's your story? I have no story.",
"Is that so? Looking at you, here in London, I would think you have a story.",
"No.",
"I have a theory.",
"I think Sir Malcolm saved your life and you owe him.",
"That's why you're here.",
"Or I saved his and now he is my responsibility.",
"Guess it comes down to much the same thing.",
"We all owe each other in the end.",
"Like her.",
"Like her.",
"You should call a priest.",
"Do you believe in God? I believe in everything.",
"Vanessa, can you hear me? Vanessa Vanessa, can you hear me? Yes.",
"I know you're very tired and that you just want to sleep, but I think you can help us.",
"You're now in a very special place.",
"Between our world and another, perhaps between life and death itself.",
"As is our Mina.",
"You must be close to her.",
"Reach out to her.",
"Find her.",
"Don't You must.",
"We might never have this chance again.",
"All of this All of this You wanted it.",
"No.",
"You allowed it to continue.",
"Please, just try.",
"How cruel you are.",
"Find her.",
"Get the fuck away from her.",
"Whatever game you think you're playing I've had enough! We need to end this.",
"- Ethan, hold on.",
"- We have to get her a priest.",
"Tonight.",
"Right now! We can bring no one else into this.",
"What might she do to them? - Like that? - You know she is not always like that.",
"She is dying.",
"The battle's over.",
"We lost.",
"Or it won.",
"Who gives a fuck? It's time to do what she wants.",
"She wants to die.",
"Then let her.",
"You mean a priest for the last rites? Yes.",
"Or for the ritual of exorcism.",
"Stop it! She's a Catholic.",
"If she believes in it, it might help her! Have you not a single shred of decency left? You know nothing! Is that what happens when you murder your way across a continent? Stop it! Stop it! You've got a girl dying in there.",
"Not some monster with fangs.",
"You want a daughter? There she is.",
"Get the priest.",
"Sir Malcolm, I swear to Christ if she's right, if you let all this happen so that you could manipulate her, I'll rip your throat out.",
"Will you give me something? - What? - To stay awake.",
"This is a cocaine derivative.",
"They used to give it to me as a child.",
"I had asthma.",
"Did it work? Yes.",
"But it left a taste for narcotics.",
"The manipulation of the body through science.",
"In Africa I was famous for eschewing drugs.",
"Form of weakness, I thought.",
"My son died there because we lost our medicine, or the porters ran off with it, I don't remember.",
"God, I honestly don't remember.",
"I left him at base camp and went off.",
"When I returned, he was dead.",

"I named it for myself.",
"No, Doctor.",
"I haven't a shred of decency left.",
"Thank you.",
"Father Matthews, Dr.",
"Victor Frankenstein.",
"- Doctor.",
"- Father.",
"Thank you for coming.",
"It is a duty to which I am accustomed.",
"Um, where is the woman? Before we go up, there's more we should tell you.",
"Come this way, please.",
"Uh, Sir Malcolm, with respect, I need only know if she's been through the sacrament of baptism and is in good standing with the Holy Church of Rome.",
"And thereby hangs a tale.",
"Uh, it's rather more complicated than that.",
"We believe have cause to believe that she is being controlled by another force, a power beyond our understanding.",
"It's our hope that you might be able to make progress where we have failed.",
"You are talking about the ritual of exorcism? Yes.",
"It's forbidden by canon law without the express permission from the Church of Rome.",
"It will not be forthcoming.",
"Meet her at least.",
"I can deliver extreme unction, I can hear her confession and I can administer the last rites.",
"More than that is impossible.",
"Give her the last rites and get the fuck out of this house, you ridiculous man.",
"I will do my duty and nothing more.",
"Come this way.",
"Do what you're here for.",
"Get him a chair.",
"Do you understand my words? Are you a Roman Catholic? Do you follow the teachings of Mother Rome and her ministers on Earth? What's her name? Vanessa.",
"My name is Father Matthews.",
"Do you know why I'm here, Vanessa? You were baptized and confirmed in the Church of Rome? Are you prepared to take extreme unction and to make your confession? I knew.",
"I knew a Matthew.",
"Dr.",
"Christopher Matthew Banning.",
"He tortured me with water too.",
"I I knew another Matthew.",
"In the ancient days.",
"He was a tax collector.",
"He died near Hierapolis.",
"It was very hot and sunny.",
"I nailed him on the sticks upside down so he would come to me faster, so he would see it.",
"Get him out! Get him out! Get him out! Get him out! Vanessa I know you're still there.",
"I'm not gonna leave you.",
"Vanessa.",
"Vanessa, please! I beg you.",
"Now.",
"Please.",
"Please.",

"There cannot be a happy end, for claw will slash and tooth will rend.",
"There cannot be a happy end, for claw will slash and tooth will rend.",
"You should be in bed.",
"I know where she is.",
    "What do you think of climate change?"
    "Nature always avenges herself on those who insult her",
    "What is magic?",
    "Magic is the art and science of causing change to occur in conformity with will. ",
    "Are you magic?",
    "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.",
    "Lucy, calm down.",
"Lucy, calm down.",
"I... I see something horrible happening.",
"You're just having another nightmare.",
"I'm scared.",
"Relax... It's only a bad dream.",
"Jonathan. You're working too hard.",
"It's not good for you.",
"I'm worried about you.",
"Good morning.",
"Ah, Harker, please come up here.",
"Yes, Mr. Renfield.",
"I have a very important job for you. And I don't trust anyone else to do it, but you.",
"You're very kind, Mr. Renfield.",
"Count Dracula...he sent me a letter from Transylvania.",
"He wants to buy a house around here.",
"I'm aware that it's a long trip to go there.",
"Where is that?",
"Somewhere over the Carpathian mountains, isn't it?",
"Yes...and there will be a large commission.",
"Oh, then I could get a larger house for Lucy.",
"She deserves a nicer house.",
"Well, this won't be easy.",
"It'll take you a long time...you'll sweat a lot...and perhaps you'll also...spill some blood.",
"It'll be good for me to get out of the city...get away from these canals...which go nowhere.",
"Transylvania...there it is, beyond the forest.",
"It's a wonderful place.",
"A little gloomy, maybe, but very exciting.",
"The Count is looking for a beautiful old house.",
"I'm going to show him the big house, near your place.",
"But it's been abandoned for years.",
"It looks like a haunted house.",
"I'm sure he'll feel very comfortable there.",
"Anyway, we'll offer it to him.",
"I'd like you to leave soon.",
"Soon? You mean, today?",
"Absolutely. I even prepared the papers.",
"It's bad business to let him wait.",
"Very well.",
"If you insist, I shall leave today.",
"Today? Are you serious?",
"Yes, to a castle in Transylvania.",
"I hear it's a strange place infested with wolves and people who see ghosts.",
"Jonathan, it scares me...I don't want you to go.",
"I'll be fine.",
"You'll be in danger.",
"Don't go.",
"Wolves. Bandits. And ghosts.",
"Don't go. I won't allow it.",
"Let's go to the ocean, now.",
"To the place where we fell in love.",
"Lucy...I don't know.",
"Sometimes I feel so ignorant.",
"Jonathan, I really have to say this...even if you think it comes from...the weak heart of a woman...your wife.",
"Yes?",
"It really comes from the strength of my heart. I feel a kind of...dark force...like a nameless deadly fear.",
"Lucy is the dearest thing in the world to me...take care of her.",
"Mina, treat her as a sister.",
"Yes.",
"Innkeeper! Quick, my supper. I must go to the castle of Count Dracula tonight.",
"Are you really going there?",
"Yes. Why?",
"It's not a safe place.",
"Why do you want to go there?",
"At midnight evil spirits come out. And people disappear without a trace.",
"Oh, come on, that's all superstition.",
"Not at all. Bad things will happen to you if you go there.",
"Besides, no coachman will dare take you there... your horse needs a rest for several days.",
"I'll find another horse.",
"Don't go, sir.",
"I know a few people...who have been on the other side...and they can tell you.",
"He also says you shouldn't go there, young man.",
"He says there's a great chasm on the way that swallows the unwary.",
"If that doesn't get you, he says the towering crags will.",
"And in the Borgo pass... the light suddenly divides and... the land begins to rise towards the heavens... and then it drops. ",
"No one has ever returned from that place.",
"The travellers say that no such castle exists there... except maybe in the imagination of man.",
"There used to be a castle there. But now it is a ghost castle. It's only a ruin.",
"And whoever enters into that land of phantoms is lost... and never returns.",
"Of vampires and bloodsuckers.",
"Of corpses which devour their own flesh.",
"Of incubuses and succubuses.",
"Of the living dead who follow strangers",
"in the night...and attack them.",
"Hmm...",
"beyond death... a curse that will last till the end of time.",
"The curse of Nosferatu.",
"Coachman, could you take me to the Borgo pass?",
"I'll pay you well.",
"There is no road to the Borgo pass.",
"But it's right there.",
"I need your coach.",
"I haven't got a coach.",
"Then I'll take one of your horses.",
"I'll double the price.",
"Sorry, sir, but I don't have any horses. Don't you see?",
"Well... I guess I'll have to walk there.",
"Count Dracula?!",
"I am Count Dracula.",
"Welcome to my castle.",
"You must be Jonathan Harker.",
"Yes.",
"Come in.",
"The night is cold and you must be tired and hungry.",
"I've got the papers here.",
"This is the layout of the house... which I'm sure you'd like to see.",
"Yes, yes.",
"Please, help yourself.",
"Please, I'm afraid you must dine alone.",
"It's nearly midnight and I partake of nothing at this hour.",
"Unfortunately, the servants are not at our disposal.",
"So allow me to see to your comfort.",
"Listen.",
"Listen. The Children of the Night make their music.",
"Ah, young man...you're like the villagers who cannot place themselves in the soul of the hunter.",
"The knife is old and could be dirty.",
"It could give you blood poisoning.",
"Please let me do it. It's the oldest remedy in the world.",
"Oh, forget it. It's hardly worth mentioning. Just a little cut.",
"You... you know...it's only for the best.",
"Let's sit down for a while.",
"It's still many hours till dawn. And during the daytime I am always away.",
"Lucy, my love...there is no postal service from here... but I shall write a diary, preserving all my thoughts and feelings for you.",
"Last night after a tiresome journey, I finally reached my destination...the castle of Count Dracula.",
"I had a bad dream, but I hope it will pass.",
"This castle is so strange.",
"At times I wonder if it isn't part of that dream.",
"Everything about it looks so unreal. I don't attach importance to the sunshine anymore...or to glittering fountains, which youth is so fond of.",
"I love the darkness and the shadows. Where I can be alone with my thoughts.",
"I am the descendent of an old family. Time is an abyss, profound as a thousand nights.",
"Centuries come and go... to be unable to grow old is terrible.",
"That is not the worst. There are things more horrible than that.",
"Can you imagine enduring centuries...experiencing the same futility each day?",
"I'm glad you found such a large old house for me.",
"Very near your lodging, I understand.",
"Yes, it's just around the corner.",
"Ah... may I have a look at the contract?",
"What?...",
"What a lovely throat.",
"It's my wife, Lucy.",
"Your hand.",
"Your hand is so cold.",
"The document... the contract for the house, I must sign it immediately.",
"Yes, but we haven't settled on a price.",
"It doesn't matter between gentlemen... I accept whatever you find just.",
"How long did it take you to get here from Wismar?",
"Four weeks.",
"I...",
"...it takes a while to travel on land.",
"From the seed of Belial is the vampire born.",
"He who feeds on the blood of mankind... who, unredeemed, taketh his refuge in caves, tombs... coffins filled with the unblessed soil of cemeteries... wherein the black death has reaped its harvest...the plague.",
"Blood is life.",
"Jonathan!",
"She has a sudden fever.",
"Her pulse is too fast.",
"She needs to rest.",
"Call me if you think it is necessary...",
"...but I don't think it's something serious.",
"Oh, God, he must",
"be going to Wismar.",
"Lucy...Lucy's in danger.",
"I've got to get out of here.",
"It's strange...but the papers are all in order.",
"Let me see them...",
"From Varna to Wismar.",
"Garden soil for botanical experiments.",
"Open one of them.",
"I want to make sure.",
"This one.",
"Mother Superior...",
"stop the black coffins.",
"The patient who came yesterday had a seizure.",
"Which one?",
"The one who had bitten a cow.",
"Oh, yes.",
"We put him in isolation.",
"I'll go with you.",
"Blood is life.",
"Blood is life.",
"Has he done it for long?",
"He has, and he also refuses food.",
"Blood is life.",
"Let's go.",
"Help! Help me!",
"Be quiet... I hear the sounds of sails fluttering in the wind.",
"Still, there's no letter from him.",
"But, don't worry, Lucy... The mail from Transylvania is very slow.",
"Something has happened",
"God is far away when we need him.",
"Young man. You're not yet well.",
"You shouldn't travel.",
"The black coffins... I must get to Wismar before the coffins.",
"You should at least wait for the doctor. He'll be here tomorrow.",
"Lucy, my wife, is in danger.",
"I must save her.",
"The black coffins.",
"Evil is on the way.",
"I'm writing because I believe there is a curse on my ship.",
"One by one, four sailors and the second mate have taken ill and died.",
"Another sailor and our cook have disappeared without a trace.",
"A rumor of a mysterious stranger on board scares everyone to death.",
"We searched the boat and we found nothing, except rats.",
"We are maintaining our course. Northwest at 30 degrees.",
"The wind is steady. 12 knots.",
"Mr. Renfield...you sent my husband to Transylvania... and I haven't heard",
"from him in weeks. I'm very concerned...I want to go there and look for him.",
"Don't go yet.",
"My master is coming.",
"Who did you say is coming?",
"The Lord of the Rats.",
"He's bringing with him thousands and thousands of rats.",
"Orderly, give him some more food.",
"I think we should leave now.",
"The plague.",
"The Master has arrived.",
"The Master has arrived.",
"Lay a gangplank across.",
"We need to search the ship.",
"Cut him loose.",
"There's not a soul on board.",
"Just some freight.",
"But there are rats everywhere.",
"Here's the ship's log.",
"It's truly a mystery.",
"I think, gentlemen, that the ship's log may give us a clue.",
"Varna, June 6. Myself, the Captain, five hands, two mates and a cook... ...direction, the Dardanelles. Course westward.",
"Today a third man died of a high fever. Last night, while on his watch, a mate disappeared without a trace.",
"June 20th. Course northward towards Biscaya.",
"Speed 40 knots. Tall waves. Fear grows among my men.",
"Now only the first mate and I remain alive.",
"There are rats everywhere.",
"Could it be a plague?",
"Go home quietly, please.",
"Shut the doors and windows, gentlemen.",
"Gracious lady, we brought this man.",
"He says he lives here.",
"Lucy!",
"Jonathan!",
"Who is this woman?",
"Bring him in, please.",
"It looks like he's suffering from brain fever.",
"The sun is hurting my eyes.",
"Dr. Van Helsing. Do you think we've all gone mad... ...and that one morning we'll all wake up and find ourselves in straight-jackets?",
"Excuse me for not knocking... I am Count Dracula.",
"",
"I know who you are.",
"I read Jonathan's diary.",
"He wrote everything that went on in your castle, while he was there.",
"- Don't worry, he won't die.",
"- Yes...he will. Death surrounds us.",
"We're all at his will.",
"The rivers continue to flow without us.",
"Time flies by.",
"Even the stars...they wander towards us in a very strange way.",
"Only death is certain.",
"Only death is cruel.",
"Death is cruelty",
"against the unsuspecting.",
"But that's not what I perceive as cruel.",
"Cruel is when you can't die even if you want to.",
"Give me some of your love...which you give Jonathan.",
"I never will.",
"I won't even give that love to God.",
"If Jonathan can't have my love...then, no one else will.",
"If I wish, he'll recognize you again.",
"But first, come and give me your love. Only then, will I give you your husband back.",
"And as for me... the absence of love... is the most abject pain.",
"The power of my love will bring him back to me.",
"And you may be assured... even the unthinkable will not deter me... that you want to lay for me.",
"Good night.",
"Stop!",
"Help! Help!",
"Nosferatu, the undead. He drinks the blood of his victims, and turns them into phantoms of the night.",
"Like a shadow, he has no reflection. He goes through walls and closed doors... as if they never existed.",
"Like a bat, he wafts into dark bedrooms. Masquerading as a black wolf, he hunts his fleeing victims.",
"Abandon all hope, you who cross his path.",
"Yet even vampires, who are considered unnatural creatures... are subject to some laws of nature.",
"The sight of the cross bans him.",
"The consecrated host...can bar his retreat.",
"And if a pure hearted woman...diverts his attention from the cry of the cock...the first light of day will obliterate him.",
"What is your wish, Master?",
"Go north... to Riga.",
"The army of rats and the Black Death will follow you.",
"Oh... Thy will be done.",
"Amen...!",
"Amen...!",
"The plague! The plague!",
"What are you doing here?",
"I must talk to the town council.",
"It's been dissolved.",
"It doesn't exist anymore.",
"Then, I must see the mayor.",
"He's dead.",
"Go back home, as fast as you can.",
"I know why this evil is happening!",
"I know why this evil is happening!",
"Why won't you listen to me?!",
"I know the reason why.",
"My child. It's all a figment of your imagination.",
"But Dr. Van Helsing...you've read Jonathan's diary. You've seen what has",
"happened to him.",
"It's getting worse here every day.",
"The plague. The rats.",
"And this book about the vampires.",
"This book explains it.",
"This is an enlightened century.",
"Science has refuted the superstitions you're talking about.",
"I know it exists.",
"I believe what I see with my own eyes.",
"Faith... Faith...",
"Yes, faith.",
"Yes, faith, Dr. Van Helsing.",
"Faith.",
"Faith is the faculty in men... which enables us to believe things... we know to be untrue.",
"You must come and help me destroy this monster.",
"We must look for him.",
"Coffins have come by boat from the Black Sea.",
"We can search for them tonight, and destroy them.",
"My child, you need some rest.",
"Your husband's condition has worn you out.",
"No, Dr. Van Helsing.",
"Tonight.",
"I need to study this matter scientifically.",
"No! Tonight! There's no time to lose.",
"Even a farmer knows that there's a time to plant and a time to sow.",
"He doesn't dig up the wheat to check if it is growing.",
"Only children playing farmers",
"would do such things.",
"I guess I'll have to do this alone!",
"Well, then.",
"Mother Superior, my medicine.",
"My lady, how exactly did we meet?",
"Join us, please.",
"Would you like a drink?",
"Be our guest.",
"We've all contracted the plague. Let's enjoy whatever time we have to live.",
"Madam Lucy! Madam Lucy!",
"Open up!",
"Come quickly to the Schraders... Something terrible has happened there.",
"Lucy, calm down.",
"You can come closer.",
"It is not the plague.",
"My God! What happened?",
"I don't know exactly.",
"She was already dead, when I arrived.",
"He lost his sanity over it, he started to rave.",
"We shall study this matter scientifically... without prejudice, and without superstition.",
"Enough! Enough. Stop acting like you know everything.",
"I know, now, what I've got to do.",
"The consecrated host bans the vampire.",
"And if a pure hearted woman, diverts his attention from the cry of the cock... the first light of day will obliterate him.",
"Too late. Oh, God... if I had only listened to her.",
"A stake and a hammer.",
"I have to dispatch this demon forever.",
"Stop. Don't do it!",
"Van Helsing!",
"Get him! Yes, him!",
"That man has murdered the Count!",
"Have you done that?",
"With that stake?",
"Yes...",
"But I had a good reason for doing it.",
"That's for the courts to decide.",
"You're under arrest, Dr. Van Helsing.",
"Arrest this man.",
"Arrest him?",
"- I can't arrest him.",
"- Then get the police.",
"The police don't exist anymore.",
"Then take him to prison.",
"There's no one there to guard him.",
"It's your duty as a town employee to handle it.",
"I don't have a weapon.",
"I don't care!",
"I want you to arrest this man!",
"Where will you take me, then?",
"I don't know where I'm taking you.",
"Take me wherever you want.",
"Don't just stand there.",
"Get a broom. It's all dusty.",
"Seal the room for an official investigation.",
"And bring me my horse.",
"I have much to do.",
"Now!",
